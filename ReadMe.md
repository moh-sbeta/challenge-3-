# Challenge 3

## Guidelines

Assessments are meant to give you and RBK staff an idea of how well you understand, or can figure out, the material that you covered recently.

- Turn off all communication devices such as your phone, email, Slack, etc.
- Fork this repo and clone down your fork to your laptop.
- Commit **working** code early and often (at least after every prompt). You are graded on your commit messages in addition to the code that you write

`[When this code is committed it will] Complete the basic-iteration prompt`

- Use the Chrome Console [Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/snippets) feature to author, test and debug your code before committing. You are **NOT PERMITTED** to use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) to work on or complete this assessment.
- Do at least a little work on _every_ prompt, even if you only leave comments that describe your intent. **Leaving a prompt blank is tantamount to failing a prompt. You'll get much more credit even for writing comments or pseudo-code that describe your intent**
- You **must** submit a pull request for all assessments **on time** (guidelines for how to submit a pull request are below). Give yourself several minutes to do this at the end of the time allotted for the assessment
- After completing the assessment, if there are any prompts you felt you did not do well on, or, that you would not know how to assess whether or not you did well on, make plans to improve your skills on that topic **as soon as possible.**

## Using and Referencing Outside Resources

You are allowed to use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org). Using _any_ other resources, online or otherwise, including previous class materials, or, communicating through any mechanism with anyone other than RBK staff during the assessments is academic dishonesty and is cause for **immediate removal from the course.** If you have any questions about whether a resource is available for use, or if you are in need of support, submit a help request.

## Submitting Solutions.

Solutions are submitted via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Follow these steps:

1. From **your fork**, select `Pull Requests` and then create a `New pull request`.

2. STOP. _Before_ you `Click to create a pull request for this comparison` you must **adjust the target branch** (aka `base branch`) to be your name.

3. Click `Send pull request`

**NOTE: Only submit one pull request per assessment.**
